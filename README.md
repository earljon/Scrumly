Scrumly
=======

Scrumly is an IOS application that provides random users within your team for the sole purpose of daily stand up during scrum.

Basic Features:
- Shuffle available items in your list of users
- Simple animation trick for each user that has been selected.

Future:
- Make it full blown tool
- Save each scrum stand up activity in a data store
- Ability to set/tag late comer
- Instead of hard coded list, connect directly to LDAP and/or external web service that will contain list of people.
